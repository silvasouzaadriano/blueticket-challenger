## A challenger for [Blueticket FullStack Developer](https://blueticket.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk03azc/) 

## Concepts

<h4>
On this challenger was implemented an API REST where is possible to authenticate users. These users also may create new events.
Also was created an web interface where may be done the user creation and the event management.
The API was created using NodeJS and the web interface was built using ReactJS.
</h4>


## Requirements

1. Only an user logged may create and edit your onwn events
2. An event created my be published or not (changing it visibility)
3. An event published became visible on general event list
4. An event only may be published with all attributes bellow fullfilled:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Bannner

    NOTE that despite of fields name, description and banner, also were introduced two more fields: event date and location. The event date is being used on frontend as paging.
